# the best thing is the scope of the variables in python 

# Variables declared outside of functions or classes have global scope and can be accessed from anywhere in the code.
# Variables declared inside a function have local scope and can only be accessed within that function

x = 10
name = "Hammad Abbas"
isValid = True
myList = [1,2,3,4]



print(x)
print(name)
print(isValid)
print(myList)

# we can reassigned the value of the variables
