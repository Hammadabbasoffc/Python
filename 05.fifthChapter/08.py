# different between arrays and lists 

    # Lists are mutable, which means they can be changed after they are created.
    # Arrays, on the other hand, are immutable, which means they cannot be changed after they are created.

    # Lists are defined with square brackets ([]), while arrays are defined with parentheses (()).
    # Lists can contain different data types, while arrays can only contain a single data type.

    # Lists can be nested, while arrays cannot be nested.
    # Lists can be used to store heterogeneous data, while arrays can only store homogeneous data.

    # Lists have built-in methods to add, remove, and sort elements, while arrays have to use custom methods to perform these operations.

    # Lists are slower to access elements compared to arrays, as they have to traverse through the entire list to find the desired element.
    # Arrays are faster to access elements compared to lists, as they use indexing to find the desired element.

    # Lists can be used to represent arrays with dynamic sizes, while arrays have a fixed size.

    # Lists can be used to store large amounts of data, while arrays may not be able to handle large amounts of data efficiently.

    # Lists can be used to store data in a specific order, while arrays do not have a specific order.

    # Lists can be used to store data in a specific format, while arrays do not have a specific format.

    # Lists can be used to store data in a specific structure, while arrays do not have a specific structure.

    # Lists can be used to store data in a specific way, while arrays do not have a specific way.
